# Maskrom Mode

The OTG interface of ROCK 3A is located on the upper USB 3.0 port, and can be used to communicate with the host computer and the board in Maskrom via the USB-A to USB-A cable.
In Maskrom mode, you can use [Rockchip Development Kit](/general-tutorial/rksdk) to write and erase your product.

Steps for the ROCK 3A to enter Maskrom mode:

1. Shutdown and disconnect the power supply.
2. Short-circuit the SPI pins as shown in the attached figure, which are the two pins near the outside of the 3-pin row of pins next to the power button.
